# Idle RPG Prototype

An idle RPG prototype developed with GameMaker, combining traditional idle mechanics with active player interaction.  
In addition to automated combat and character abilities, players can directly support their characters using mouse input to influence the outcome of battles.

This project focuses on gameplay feel, interaction design, and combining idle systems with active engagement.

## Core Concept

Unlike traditional idle RPGs where the player mainly observes progress, this game introduces **active support mechanics**:

- Clicking your character **heals them**
- Clicking enemies **deals small amounts of damage**
- Clicking the coin generates **gold**
- Enemies also generate gold when defeated
- Characters have **multiple usable abilities**

The goal is to blend idle progression with meaningful player interaction.
